# Introduction 
The Goal of this project is to determine which independent variables have the most influence on the 
dependent variable, which is in this case the satisfaction of the passengers. It is important for an airline 
to know what customers value the most, in order to improve the customer experience and increase the 
customer flow. This project covers the preprocessing steps, the exploration of the data and 
implementation of KNN and the Na√Øve Bayes models.
